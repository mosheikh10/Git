# Commit Hygiene & Best Practices

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages — explain *what* and *why*, not just *how*.

- Use squashing before merging PRs — combine small/related commits into one clean, meaningful commit.

- One logical change per commit — keeps history readable and makes revert or debug easier.

- Avoid noisy commit names like `fix`, `final`, `fixfixfinal2` — be specific and professional.
