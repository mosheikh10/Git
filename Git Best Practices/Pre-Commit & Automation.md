# Pre-Commit & Automation

1. Run linters and tests before committing (e.g., `pre-commit`, Husky, `tflint`, `eslint`, etc.)  
   → Catches errors early — before they reach the repo.

2. Prevent broken or poorly formatted code from entering the repository  
   → Keeps code quality consistent for everyone.

3. Hook into CI pipelines for automated formatting, testing, and security scanning  
   → Ensures every change meets team standards — even if you forget to run checks locally.
