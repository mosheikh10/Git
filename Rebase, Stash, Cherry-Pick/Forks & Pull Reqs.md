# Forks & Pull Requests (PRs)

- **Fork** = your own personal copy of someone else’s repository (on GitHub).  
  → You can experiment freely without affecting the original.

- **Clone** the forked repo to your local machine → work on it like any other project.

- Make changes locally → `git push` them to your fork (not the original repo).

- Open a **Pull Request (PR)** → propose your changes to be merged into the original repo.

- Used widely in open source and cross-team collaboration — lets others review, comment, and approve before merging.

- The **original repo owner** has full control: they can review, request changes, or merge your PR.
