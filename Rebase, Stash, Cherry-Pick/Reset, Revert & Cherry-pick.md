# Git Revert, Reset & Cherry-Pick

## ðŸŸ¦ git revert
- Creates a *new* commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit.
- Safe for shared history (like production or team branches) â€” doesnâ€™t rewrite history.
- Use when you need to undo something without breaking othersâ€™ work.

## ðŸŸ§ git reset
- Moves your branch pointer backward to an earlier commit.
  - `--soft`: keeps changes staged (ready to re-commit).
  - `--mixed` (default): unstages changes but keeps them in your working directory.
  - `--hard`: deletes all changes â€” use with caution!
- Rewrites history â€” best for local, unshared branches.

## ðŸŸ¦ git cherry-pick
- Applies a *single* commit from one branch onto your current branch.
- Great for pulling specific fixes (like hotfixes) into another branch without merging everything.
- Useful for targeted changes â€” not whole branches.

  ## Explanation

git revert

Before:
A â†’ B â†’ C (bad commit)

Command:
git revert C

After:
A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ C'

C' is a new commit that undoes C.
Safe for shared branches (doesnâ€™t rewrite history).

git reset

Before:
A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ D (current HEAD)

Command:
git reset --hard B

After:
A â†’ B

Commits C and D are removed from history.
Rewrites history â€” only safe for local branches.

git cherry-pick

Before:
main: A â†’ B
feature-login: A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ D

Command (on main):
git cherry-pick D

After:
main: A â†’ B â†’ D'
feature-login: A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ D

D' is a copy of D applied onto main.
Only that one commit is brought over â€” history stays clean.
