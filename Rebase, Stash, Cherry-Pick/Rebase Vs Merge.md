# Rebase vs Merge

## 🟠 Merge
- Preserves full commit history — nothing is changed or removed.
- Creates a new “merge commit” to tie branches together.
- Best for team workflows — keeps everyone’s work visible and intact.

## 🔵 Rebase
- Rewrites history to make it look linear (no merge commits).
- No extra merge commits — cleaner, simpler history.
- Ideal for cleaning up your local branch before submitting a pull request (PR).
- Good for cleanup:
    - Because it creates a neat, linear history — like you always worked on top of the latest main. It's like you started coding after main got updated to latest version.

 Use **Merge** when:  
Working with others — keeps collaboration clear and safe.

 Use **Rebase** when:  
Cleaning up your own local branch before sharing it — makes the history neat and focused.
