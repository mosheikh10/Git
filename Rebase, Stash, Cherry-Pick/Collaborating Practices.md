# Collaborating Practices

- Use branches to isolate your work — keeps main branch clean and avoids conflicts.

- Push your changes to the remote repo and open a Pull Request (PR) to propose merging.

- Assign reviewers and use GitHub’s UI to leave comments, ask questions, or suggest edits.

- Resolve any merge conflicts before merging — don’t leave them for others to fix.

- Use Issues, Projects, and Discussions to track tasks, plan features, and organize team work.

- Keep commits focused and clean — each commit should do one thing, with a clear message.

# Typical Workflow (Working in a Team)

1. **Developer pulls latest `main`** (or clones the repo)  
   → Starts with up-to-date code.

2. **Creates a feature branch**  
   → Isolates new work from main branch.

3. **Works locally → commits changes → pushes branch**  
   → Saves progress and shares it with the team.

4. **Opens a Pull Request (PR) or Merge Request (MR)**  
   → Asks for review, feedback, and approval to merge.

5. **Team syncs regularly via `git pull --rebase` or `git merge`**  
   → Stays updated with team changes without creating messy history.
