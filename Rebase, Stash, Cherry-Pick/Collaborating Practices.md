# Collaborating Practices

- Use branches to isolate your work — keeps main branch clean and avoids conflicts.

- Push your changes to the remote repo and open a Pull Request (PR) to propose merging.

- Assign reviewers and use GitHub’s UI to leave comments, ask questions, or suggest edits.

- Resolve any merge conflicts before merging — don’t leave them for others to fix.

- Use Issues, Projects, and Discussions to track tasks, plan features, and organize team work.

- Keep commits focused and clean — each commit should do one thing, with a clear message.
